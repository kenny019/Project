**To use the CO2 data of classroom in engineering school from the school data to derive and display:**

The average CO2 recorded of classroom EN14-5-68 and EN14-5-69 for a selected timing

The difference between the CO2 reading of classroom EN14-5-68 and EN14-5-69 from 7am to 6pm

The ‘Superior’ and ‘Very Good’ readings of a selected classrooms

The top 4 highest CO2 readings and the corresponding time among all the classrooms
